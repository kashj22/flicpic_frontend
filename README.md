# WDI Project 4: FlicPic

## Synopsis

In our final project on the Web Development Immersive course at General Assembly, I developed an app using the MEAN Stack technologies 
we learned in our last few weeks, to create something for movie lovers. As I had done with a previous project, I wanted to identify
a problem I had faced in the past and tackle it with the help of technology.

The different users of this app would include people like myself, who want to watch a film but don't know what exactly, people who see 
posters or trailers for a film and want to be reminded to watch them, or couples or groups of friends who are having a movie night and
need to decide on a film to watch quickly. All of the users in this scenario want to make a quick decision. They aren't worried about
the cast, the trailer, the ratings or the synopsis. They just need their memories jogged with the image or poster of a film to remind
them that it's a film they wanted to watch or one that looks interesting to watch now. Thus, FlicPic is the app to use.

## Technologies

We used MEAN Stack technologies for our final project, which meant I used NodeJS and Express on the backend, MongoDB as the server and
AngularJS on the front end. Styling was done using the Materialize CSS framework. I also used The Movie Database API (TMDb) to access
all info regarding the movies searched for in our app. 

# Future Work

This was my first concrete attempt at anything with MEAN Stack, and although I'm happy with what I achieved, There's more I would like
to do. For starters, I want users to be able to search not only for movie titles or genres, but also for actors, time periods and a 
combination of all. I would also like the users to see one poster at a time, and for them to swipe right if they are interested in 
watching it, or left if they aren't. For all of the movies they swiped right on, this is added to a database of films that particular
users wants to watch, and they can then access further information about the film, such as synopsis, reviews etc. This information can
also be pulled from the movie database API.
